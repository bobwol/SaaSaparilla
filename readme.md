### Welcome to our GitHub Repository

Building a WordPress-based Software as a Service platform has never been easier! Unlike similar plugins, SaaSaparilla has been built around the model proven by our friends at [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com). Rather than try to accomplish everything, we focus on one singular goal, building a basic SaaS platform, and allow you to extend it as you see fit.

More information can be found at [saasaparilla.com](https://saasaparilla.com/).
